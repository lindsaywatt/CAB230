# CAB230 Website - Parkz
This is the full code and resources for our submission for the major assesment in CAB230 - Web Computing, a web development subject at QUT - Queensland University of Technology.
The assignment required us to build a website that displayed items, and allowed users to login and leave reviews on items from a local Council open data database. We used a parks database.
We recieved 97% for this assignment, and it was chosen by the lecturer and tutors as the best website of the class.
This was a pair assignment, my partner was a good friend of mine.

Usage notes:
 - Import the database file 'database.sql' into MySQL on your server.
 - Edit /include/database_connection.php so that the paramaters in the PDO connection match your MySQL database.

Enjoy.
